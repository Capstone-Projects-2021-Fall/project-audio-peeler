# Audio Peeler Capstone Project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audio Peeler is a web application that allows the user to upload or search a song and then download the component parts of the song. These parts are usually instruments but will vary based on the media file presented. Audio Peeler is written with a Python-based backend that uses the Demucs API to handle the audio file separations. The JavaScript frontend will handle the user interactions and give the user a clean interface to use the application. Due to the application being written in JavaScript, the applicaiton should be mobile friendly. The frontend will also be styled using CSS as well as handle user input using HTML elements.

1. clone or download this project
