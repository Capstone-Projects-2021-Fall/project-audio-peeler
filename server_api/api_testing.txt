The API will be used for the following:
    - accept a file uploaded by the client
    - send the file through DEMUCS to receive component audio files
    - send the client back the component audio files

The file upload will accept:
    - individual
    - audio type

Multiple file uploads should result in an error on the client's side, error tells client that only one file may be uploaded at a time
Audio Type will result in an error on the client's side; communicates with client that audio files are the only file type accepted (for now)

The file being sent through DEMUCS:
    - DEMUCS must be online and available

If DEMUCS is not online and available to receive and process the files then the API will print out to the client that the server is not responding

Sending the client back the component audio files:
    - Client must have enough RAM to temporarily store the audio files on their machine

If the client does not have enough memory to hold the audio files the client will receive an error stating that there is not enough room on the machine.
This message may have to be given before the files are sent back to the client in order for them to receive the error message.
